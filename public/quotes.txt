Time waits for no one, but we can choose how to dance with it.
Cherish each moment, for it becomes the most valuable part of your memories.

Seize today, and you hold the key to tomorrow.
Time isn’t meant to be waited on; it’s meant to create miracles with.
Time is the fairest resource—it gives equally to all; it’s how you use it that matters.
Yesterday is experience, today is a gift, and tomorrow is the continuation of dreams.
Instead of complaining about time, adjust your pace to move with it.
Time is the canvas of life; how you paint it determines its beauty.
